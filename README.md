Artificial Neural Network (ANN):

An artificial neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the biological neural networks in the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, called neurons, organized in layers. Each neuron receives input signals, processes them, and produces an output signal that is passed on to other neurons. The strength of the connections between neurons, known as weights, is adjusted during the learning process to enable the network to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

CNNs are primarily used for image recognition and computer vision tasks. They consist of multiple layers of neurons that apply convolution operations to the input data, allowing them to automatically learn features like edges, textures, and patterns from images.
CNNs have revolutionized fields like object detection, image classification, and image segmentation.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

RNNs are designed to work with sequential data where the order of inputs matters, such as time series data, text, and speech.
Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that form loops, allowing information to persist over time. This makes them suitable for tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation.

Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs):

LSTMs and GRUs are specialized types of RNNs that address the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur when training traditional RNNs on long sequences of data.
They incorporate mechanisms to selectively retain or forget information over time, making them well-suited for tasks that involve learning from long sequences of data, such as speech recognition, text generation, and sentiment analysis.
